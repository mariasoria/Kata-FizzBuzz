# FizzBuzz


Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to _number_ .

**Rules:**

* For multiples of 3 print Fizz instead of the number.
* For the multiples of 5 print Buzz instead of the number.
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz instead of the number.


**Input:**

number = 15

**Output:**

["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"]


## Stage 2

New requirements:
* A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it.
* A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it.
* A number is fizzbuzz if it is divisible by 3&5 or if it has a 3 and a 5 in it.
